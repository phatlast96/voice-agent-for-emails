# Voice Agent for Emails

## Getting Started

This project requires both Supabase and Next.js to be running simultaneously.

### Goals
- Build a local voice agent that can answer questions about a userâ€™s emails (including PDF attachments), and can send emails
- Scope: local-only (no cloud deployment); OK to use cloud-hosted LLM/STT/TTS APIs
- Data: OAuth into Gmail, crawl at least 200 emails with attachments, store locally
- Product: working UI (web) to configure auth/keys, run crawl, and query via voice
- Deliverable: GitHub repo runnable locally; due Friday morning
- Optional tools mentioned: LiveKit/Pipecat/WebRTC for voice; any local DB for storage

### Starting the development server

1. Navigate to the root folder:
   ```bash
   cd voice-agent-for-emails
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```


### Starting Supabase

1. Navigate to the `supabase` folder:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   ```

2. Start Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

3. Run the migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```
### Starting Next.js

1. Navigate to the `webapp` folder:
   ```bash
   cd webapp
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running Both Services

You'll need to run both services in separate terminal windows/tabs:

- **Terminal 1**: Run Supabase (from the `supabase` folder)
- **Terminal 2**: Run Next.js (from the `webapp` folder)

Once both are running, you can access the Next.js application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your Next.js configuration).
